            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Python enthusiast with hands-on experience in building and deploying a variety of projects, from scientific data visualizations to web applications and machine learning models. Throughout my projects, I have honed my skills in data analysis, web development, and problem-solving, with a strong focus on clear communication and documentation.</p>
            <h3>Key Skills:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python Programming:</strong> Developed solutions for diverse tasks, including scientific data visualization, web scraping, and task management APIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Utilized libraries like <strong>Matplotlib</strong> and <strong>Seaborn</strong> to process and visualize complex datasets, effectively communicating insights from weather, health, and biological data.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Built small applications using <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>, demonstrating proficiency in creating web-based tools like code repositories and task management APIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Implemented basic AI models using <strong>scikit-learn</strong>, applying machine learning techniques to solve classification problems, and documenting each step of the process for educational purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Developed scrapers with <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> and <strong>Scrapy</strong>, extracting valuable data from websites and storing it in structured formats like <strong>CSV</strong> and <strong>JSON</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Writing:</strong> Authored tutorials and blog posts that explain Python concepts in simple terms, ensuring that both technical and non-technical audiences can grasp fundamental programming concepts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I enjoy tackling complex challenges and breaking them down into manageable tasks, whether it's building a simple Python calculator or creating a machine learning model. My ability to explain technical concepts in an accessible manner is reflected in my work, and I continually strive to improve both my coding skills and my ability to communicate those skills to others.</p>

        <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <h3>1. Scientific Data Visualization with Python</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Create a data visualization project that processes a publicly available scientific dataset (such as weather data, COVID-19 statistics, or a biological dataset) and visualizes the results using Python libraries like <strong>Matplotlib</strong> or <strong>Seaborn</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Python, data analysis, data visualization, and communicating scientific data clearly.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Touch:</strong> Write a brief report explaining your findings and the steps you took to visualize the data.</p>

            <h3>2. Interactive Python-Based Calculator or Unit Converter</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Build a simple command-line or web-based Python app that allows users to convert between different units (temperature, distance, currency, etc.) or perform scientific calculations (like calculating the area of geometric shapes or solving basic algebraic equations).</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Python programming, user input handling, basic algorithms.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Touch:</strong> If possible, add an intuitive error-handling feature to ensure user-friendly interaction.</p>

            <h3>3. Python Code Snippet Documentation Site</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Create a small web app or document repository (using <strong>Flask</strong> or <strong>Django</strong>) to store and share commonly used Python code snippets (like how to reverse a list, create a dictionary, or parse JSON). You can add brief explanations for each snippet in plain English to make it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Python, web development (Flask/Django), technical writing, and the ability to explain concepts clearly.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Touch:</strong> Add a search functionality to easily find specific snippets.</p>

            <h3>4. Simple AI Model with Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Implement a basic machine learning model (e.g., using <strong>scikit-learn</strong>) that performs a task like classification (e.g., classifying flowers in the Iris dataset). Ensure that you also document and explain each step, from data preprocessing to training and evaluation, in clear language.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Python, machine learning, problem-solving, and ability to explain technical concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Touch:</strong> Write a concise technical blog post explaining your approach and results.</p>

            <h3>5. Python Web Scraper with Output to CSV/JSON</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Build a simple Python web scraper using <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> or <strong>Scrapy</strong> to extract data from a website (e.g., a list of articles, products, or stock prices) and save the results to a CSV or JSON file.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Python, web scraping, working with APIs and data storage formats.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Touch:</strong> Add a brief written explanation of the scraping process and any challenges you faced.</p>

            <h3>6. Simple Flask API for Task Management</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Create a small API using <strong>Flask</strong> that lets users add, view, and delete tasks in a to-do list. The project will showcase basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and a RESTful API design.</p>
